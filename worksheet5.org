* Pumping Lemma 
Prove, using the pumping lemma, that the following languages are not regular: 

+ {w | w has an twice as many 1s as 0s} 
+ (\Sigma = {0,1,2}) {0^n 1^m 2^k | where m must be bigger than n or k}
+ {m+n=k| m,n,k are all binary numbers and m + n = k /as numbers/} (Note that in this problem \Sigma = {0,1,+,=})

Then write down a couple of languages and either define a DFA, NFA, or RegExp for them *or* prove they're not regular.
