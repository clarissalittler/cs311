* NFAs to DFAs
  Write an NFA for the following language and then convert it into a DFA: 
  {w | w is an even number of 0s or an odd number of 1s} (/or/ not /and/ or /xor/)

* Constructions and NFAs
  Consider the following languages 
  + L_1 = { w | w has less than 3 0s}
  + L_2 = { w | w has the substring 0101}

  Now:
  + write down NFAs for each of these
  + combine them to make NFAs for the following languages
    + $L_1 \cdot L_2$
    + $L_1 \cup L_2$
    + $L_1^*$
    + $L_2^*$
