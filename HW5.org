* HW 5: Lambda Calculi and Time Complexity
** Problem 1
   Consider a binary tree that is either
   + a leaf
   + or a node with two other binary trees as its descendants
  You should 
   1. give this datatype a church encoding in the untyped lambda calculus
   2. write a function that returns true if its argument is a node and false if its a leaf
   3. write a function that counts the number of nodes in a tree (for this purpose just assume that numbers exist as a datatype and are equipped with binary addition)
** Problem 2
   (from Sipser) Let Double-SAT be the language { \phi | \phi has at least two satisfying assignments }. Show, by polynomial time reduction, that Double-SAT is NP-complete.

** Problem 3
   (from Sipser) Show that, if P = NP, then every language A \in P that is not trivial (either \varempty or \Sigma^*) is NP-complete.
