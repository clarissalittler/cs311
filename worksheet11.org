#+TITLE: In-Class Worksheet 11: Computable Reductions
#+AUTHOR: Clarissa Littler
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Construct the following reductions

+ A computational reduction from the ordinary halting problem to H'_{TM} = { M | M halts on every input}
+ A computational reduction /from/ the language { 0^{2^n} | n \ge 0} to the language {0} (this is actually an example of a more general principle)
+ A reduction from the language {(N,w) | N is an NFA that accepts w} /to/ the language {(M,w) | M is a DFA that accepts w}
+ A reduction from the E_{TM} = { M | L(M) = \emptyset} to L_{TM} = { M | M loops on every input}
+ Construct a reduction from $\overline{A_{TM}}$ to E_{TM}


+ Prove that $A_{TM} \le \overline{E_{TM}}$
+ Prove that ${0^n1^n} \le {0^n}$
+ Prove that EQ_{TM} is not decidable
