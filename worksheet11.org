#+TITLE: In-Class Worksheet 11: Computable Reductions
#+AUTHOR: Clarissa Littler
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Construct the following reductions

+ A computational reduction from the ordinary halting problem to H'_{TM} = { M | M halts on every input}
+ A computational reduction /from/ the language { 0^{2^n} | n \ge 0} to the language {0} (this is actually an example of a more general principle)
+ A reduction from the language {(N,w) | N is an NFA that accepts w} /to/ the language {(M,w) | M is a DFA that accepts w}
