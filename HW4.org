* HW 4: Computable Reductions
** Problem 1
   Show that the language $ALL_{TM}$, defined as $\{M | \text{ where } M \text{ is a TM and } L(M) = \Sigma^*\}$, is undecidable.
** Problem 2
   A *useless state* in a Turing machine is defined as a state that is never entered by the machine on any input. Consider the problem of detecting if a Turing machine has a useless state. Formulate this problem /as a language/ and show that the language is undecidable.
** Problem 3
   If $A \le_m B$ and $B$ is a regular language, is $A$ necessarily a regular language? Justify your answer.
** Problem 4
   Let $B$ be a decidable language with $B \neq \emptyset$ and $B \neq \Sigma^*$, then if $A$ is decidable define a computational reduction $A \le_m B$.
