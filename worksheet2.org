* NFAs
  Try to write NFAs for the following languages
  + { w | w has at least three 1s }
    #+BEGIN_SRC dot :file WS211.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng :exports results
      digraph N {
       rankdir = LR;
       size="2,2";
       node [shape = doublecircle]; q3;
       node [shape = circle];
       q0 -> q0 [label = "0,1"];
       q1 -> q1 [label = "0,1"];
       q2 -> q2 [label = "0,1"];
       q3 -> q3 [label = "0,1"];
       q0 -> q1 [label = "1"];
       q1 -> q2 [label = "1"];
       q2 -> q3 [label = "1"];
      }
    #+END_SRC
  + { w | w is matched by the regular expression 10^*(1|0)}
    #+BEGIN_SRC dot :file WS212.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng :exports results
      digraph N {
        rankdir = LR;
        size="2,2";
        node [shape = doublecircle]; q2;
        node [shape = circle];
        q0 -> q1 = [label = "1"];
        q1 -> q1 = [label = "0"];
        q1 -> q2 = [label = "1,0"];
      }
    #+END_SRC
* Unions and Intersections
  Write DFAs for the following two languages, then take both the union and intersection. When you're done, do the same thing with them as NFAs and take the union of the NFAs.
  + {w | w starts with 3 0s}
    DFA: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC dot :file WS221D.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng :exports results
      digraph N {
        rankdir = LR;
        size="2,2";
        node [shape = doublecircle]; q3;
        node [shape = circle];
        q0 -> qe [label = "1"];
        q1 -> qe [label = "1"];
        q2 -> qe [label = "1"];
        q0 -> q1 [label = "0"];
        q1 -> q2 [label = "0"];
        q2 -> q3 [label = "0"];
        q3 -> q3 [label = "0,1"];
