#+TITLE: In-Class Worksheet 8: Context-Free Pumping Lemma
#+AUTHOR: Clarissa Littler
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Try to prove, using the context-free pumping lemma, that the following languages are not context-free.

+ { ww^{R}w | w \in {0,1}^* }
+ {m+n=p | where m,n,p are binary strings and m + n = p /as numbers/}
+ { 0^{2^n} | n \ge 0} (this one is a bit tricky)
