#+TITLE: In-Class Worksheet 1: DFAs and Simple Proofs

* DFAs
Try to write down DFAs for the following languages
   + { w | w starts with 3 0s or 3 1s}
   + { w | w is matched by the regular expression 10^*(1|0)} (this is a preview of a connection we'll be making formally later!)
* An Inductive Proof
Prove, by induction over natural numbers, that every number is either even or odd. This should be a very simple proof, but the goal is to get used to the idea of natural induction.
* A Proof by Contradiction
  Prove, by contradiction, that the negative of an irrational number is irrational
