Give a polynomial time non-deterministic Turing machine and verifier for the following problems

+ {(G , s , t) | G has a Hamiltonian path from s to t}
+ { n | n is not a prime number }
+ { (S,t) | S is a set of numbers that has a subset that sums to t }
+ { (M,w,n) | M is a non-deterministic Turing machine, w is a string, and M has a computational path that accepts w in n steps or under }

Is the following language decidable?
{ (x , P) | P is a C-program and x is a variable that gets initialized during some execution path}
