#+TITLE: In-Class Worksheet 7: Equivalence of CFGs and PDAs
#+AUTHOR: Clarissa Littler

For this exercise try the following:

+ Write down any three CFGs you want
+ Convert them, using the procedure in class, to PDAs

Prove, using the CFL pumping lemma, that the following language is /not/ context-free

+ { 0^n1^{m}2^{2m} | n >= 0 \wedge m > n}
